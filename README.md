# fcc-voting-app
A site for friends to create polls and other friends to vote on them as laid out by the description on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).

FreeCodeCamp teaches using a MEAN stack but I don't particularly care for Node or Mongo so I'm building this in Rails and PostgreSQL.
