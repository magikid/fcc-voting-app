# fcc-voting-app
A site for friends to create polls and other friends to vote on them as laid out
by the description on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).

FreeCodeCamp teaches using a MEAN stack but I don't particularly care for Node
or Mongo so I'm building this in Rails and PostgreSQL. 

## Setup
To hack on this project, you'll need:

- Ruby 2.4 (I recommend using [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby))
- Rails 5
- PostgreSQL 9.6.2

Once you have those prereqs satisfied, clone the project and run `bin/rails
db:setup`.  Hack.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome.  Please ensure that you have included a test for your
change.
